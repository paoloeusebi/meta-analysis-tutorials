## Outline

- Meta-analysis
- Heterogeneity
- Fixed effects model
- Random effects model
- Publication bias

## Definition

Meta-analysis is a quantitative approach for systematically combining results of  previous studies to arrive at conclusions about the body of research

- Quantitative: numbers 
- Systematic: methodical 
- Combining: putting together / summing up
- Previous research: already done 
- Conclusions: new knowledge 

A study collects data from individual subjects

A meta-analysis collects data from individual studies

## Why

- Identify heterogeneity in effects among multiple studies and, where appropriate, provide summary measure
- Increase statistical power and precision to detect an effect
- Reduce the subjectivity of study comparisons by using systematic and explicit comparison procedure
- Identify data gap in the knowledge base and suggest direction for future research
- Calculate sample size for future studies

## Could we just add the data from all the trials togheter?

* One approach to combining trials would be to add all the treatment groups together, add all the control groups together, and compare the totals
* This is wrong for several reasons, and it can give the wrong answer
* Breaks the power of randomization
* Imbalances within trials introduce bias


## A two-stage process

1. A summary statistic is calculated for each study, to describe the observed intervention effect.

2. A summary (combined) intervention effect estimate is calculated as a weighted average. 

$$ \widehat y = \frac{\sum y_{i} \cdot w_{i}}{\sum w_{i}} $$

$y_{i}$ study estimate

$w_{i}$ study weight


## The inverse-variance method

* The weight given to each study is chosen to be the inverse of the variance of the effect estimate

* Larger studies, which have smaller standard errors, are given more weight than smaller studies, which have larger standard errors. 

* This choice of weights minimizes the imprecision (uncertainty) of the pooled effect estimate.

$$ \widehat y = \frac{\sum y_{i} \cdot (1/V_i)}{\sum (1/V_i)} $$

$$ w_{i} = 1/V_i $$


## Thrombolysis in Stroke (Cochrane Review 2014)

**Population**: Acute ischaemic stroke

**Intervention**: Any thrombolytic agent

**Comparison**: Placebo

**Outcome**: Death or dependency by time to treatment up to 6 hours

df <- read_excel("thrombolysis.xlsx")

```

## Thrombolysis in Stroke (Cochrane Review 2014)

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(meta)
a <- metabin(event.e = d.trom,
             n.e = n.trom,
             event.c = d.cont,
             n.c = n.cont, studlab = paste(Study, Year),
             data = df)       
forest(a, overall = F, plotwidth = "4.5cm")   
```


## Heterogeneity

**Definition**

Heterogeneity is the variation between the studies results.

**Sources**

* Patients: diagnosis, in- and exclusion criteria, etc.

* Interventions: type, dose, duration, etc.

* Outcomes: type, scale, cut-off points, duration of follow-up, etc.

* Quality and methodology: randomised or not, allocation concealment, blinding, etc.

* ...


## Heterogeneity

**Forest plot**

Do confidence intervals of studies overlap with each other and the summary effect?


**Statistics**

* Chi-square test for heterogeneity (e.g. Cochran Q test)
Tests whether the individual effects are farther away from the common effect, beyond what is expected by chance. Poor power (P-value < 0.10 indicates significant heterogeneity)

* $I^2$ statistics (function of Q)


## Heterogeneity

Thresholds for the interpretation of the $I^2$ statistic can be misleading, since the importance of inconsistency depends on several factors. 

A rough guide to interpretation in the context of meta-analyses of randomized trials is as follows:

* 0% to 40%: might not be important;
* 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity*;
* 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity*;
* 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity*.

## How to deal with heterogeneity

* Do not pool at all

* Ignore heterogeneity: use fixed effect model

* Allow for heterogeneity: use random effects model

* Explore heterogeneity


## Meta-analysis of binary data

1. Mantel-Haenszel method 
2. Peto method 
3. Maximum-Likelihood 
4. Exact methods of interval estimation
Fixed effect meta-analysis


## Fixed effect meta-analysis

Fixed effects model assumes that the true effect of treatment is common in each study.

$$ \widehat y = \frac{\sum y_{i} \cdot (1/SE_i)}{\sum (1/SE_i)} $$

$$ w_{i} = 1/SE_i $$


## Fixed effect meta-analysis
```{r, echo = T}
a <- metabin(event.e = d.trom,
             n.e = n.trom,
             event.c = d.cont,
             n.c = n.cont,
             sm = "OR",
             method = "Peto",
             studlab = paste(Study, Year),
             data = df)
```

## Fixed effect meta-analysis

```{r, echo = T}
summary(a,
        comb.random = FALSE)
```

## Fixed effect meta-analysis

```{r}
forest(a, comb.random = FALSE, plotwidth = "2.65cm")   
```


## Random effect meta-analysis

The treatment effects for the individual studies are assumed to vary around some overall average treatment effect 

Allows for random error plus inter-study variability 

$$ \widehat y = \frac{\sum y_{i} \cdot 1/(V_i+T^2)}{\sum 1/(V_i+T^2)} $$

$$ w_{i} = 1/(V_i+T^2) $$

## Random effect meta-analysis

There are several approaches to be taken:

* Method of moments approach (e.g. DerSimonian-Laird)
* Hartung-Makambi 
* Sidik-Jonkman 
* Restricted Maximum Likelihood 

*Langan et al. A comparison of heterogeneity variance estimators in simulated random-effects meta-analyses. Res Synth Methods 2019*

## Random effect meta-analysis

```{r, echo = T}
r <- metabin(event.e = d.trom,
             n.e = n.trom,
             event.c = d.cont,
             n.c = n.cont,
             sm = "OR",
             method = "Peto",
             method.tau = "REML",
             studlab = paste(Study, Year),
             comb.fixed = FALSE,
             comb.random = TRUE,
             data = df)
```

## Random effect meta-analysis

```{r, echo = T}
summary(r)
```

## Random effect meta-analysis

```{r}
forest(r, comb.fixed = FALSE, plotwidth = "2.35cm")   
```

## Random effect meta-analysis: prediction interval

```{r}
forest(r, prediction = TRUE, plotwidth = "2.35cm")   
```

## Random effect meta-analysis: prediction interval

When there are many studies in a meta-analysis, we may obtain a very tight confidence interval around the random-effects estimate of the mean effect even when there is a large amount of heterogeneity. 

A solution to this problem is to consider a prediction interval

## Which model should we choose?

Fixed-effect model

- all the studies are functionally identical. 
- the goal is to compute the common effect size, which would not be generalized beyond the (narrowly defined) population included in the analysis. 


Random-effects model

- studies have enough in common, but they are not identical


## Which model should we choose?

Therefore, in the vast majority of meta-analyses the random-effects model would be the more appropriate choice. 

It:

* is more likely to fit the actual sampling distribution;
* does not impose a restriction of a common effect size;
* yields the identical results as the fixed-effect model in the absence of heterogeneity;
* allows greater generalizability.

## Subgroups

```{r}
a1 <- update(r, 
             byvar = Timing,
             bylab = "Time",
             comb.fixed = F, comb.rand = T)
forest(a1, plotwidth = "2.5cm")
```


## Subgroups

```{r}
summary(a1)
```


## Meta-regression

```{r}
mu2 <- update(a,
              byvar = Timing, tau.common = TRUE, comb.fixed = FALSE)
fit <- metareg(mu2)
summary(fit)
```


## Publication bias: funnel plot

```{r}
funnel(a, xlab = "Hedges' g")
```

## Publication bias: test
```{r}
metabias(r)
```

## Conventional effect measures

**Binary**

* RR (Relative Risk)
* OR (Odds Ratio)
* RD (Risk Difference)

**Continuous**

* MD (Mean Difference)
* SMD (Standardized Mean Difference)
